This is a simple password generator outputting to a text file. I will be adding protections to the .txt file with a password to the .txt file or just encrypting it all into one package.
You can build your own with Windows-key +r, now type CMD, navigate to the place you stored the repo. In the main folder you will see generator.py.
Using CMD, CD to the folder you stored the files, "CD D:\"the place you stored the files"," now just type " pyinstaller --onefile generator.py". It will build it to your system in the dist folder.
You will need a few packages for python installed to do this. I don't know what you have installed so run the script and install what it asks for. Your search engine of choice will give you directions.
on how to install the files it is asking for. Just search for it.

If you want to use it without building a new program, use the program in the dist folder. Pick a location to store the text file on the first run.
